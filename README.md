## Introduction
This is a general repository for some personal projects I'm working on.
Below, you will find short descriptions of each.  

### FLB Reporter 
This is a data cleaner and report producer script. It takes practice logs
from Baltimore Urban Debate League and formats the data for Family League
of Baltimore reports.

### Snake
This is a traditional game of Snake. Just a chance for me to play around
with PyGame.

### Sneaky Fashy and Secret Hitler Remote
Sneaky Fashy will be a final product of an attempt to make a web-based
game inspired by Secret Hitler. I'm using Flask as the framework to 
make the webserver work. 

Secret Hitler Remote is a Google Spreadsheet
with a very complex macro backend. I gave up on it because it was 
definitely not built for what I was trying to do.

### Covid Data
This iPython notebook has a class that is made up of data stuctures
and analysis functions to interpret the global data on Covid 19 cases
published by Johns Hokins University and served by covid19api.

### Video Game Webscrape
This tool takes a list of video game titles and scrapes important info about the game from Mobygames.com.

### Using this Code
I have no idea why someone would want to use this code, but you may use it 
for nonprofit reasons.
